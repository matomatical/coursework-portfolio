# Coursework Portfolio

A directory of of my advanced coursework projects from the Master of Computer
Science at The University of Melbourne

## Notes

* While the reports written for my university projects usually end up quite
  polished by the submission deadline, the code usually does *not*.
  This code is usually written over a short project timescale, typically a
  only a few weeks. It's often not intended for readability. I encourage
  not looking too closely.

* Publication here does not grant you permission to use my work.
  If you are a student, please do your own projects.
