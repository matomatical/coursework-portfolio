# Coursework Portfolio

A directory of of my advanced coursework projects from the Master of Computer
Science at The University of Melbourne

## Notes

* While the reports written for my university projects usually end up quite
  polished by the submission deadline, the code usually does *not*.
  This code is usually written over a short project timescale, typically a
  only a few weeks. It's often not intended for readability. I encourage
  not looking too closely.

## Projects

The following is a list of my most recent substantial coursework projects,
with links to samples of my work, and some comments on what I learned.

### Semester 2, 2020 ðŸ¦  

This semester was completed at the University of Melbourne's virtual campus.

#### COMP90044 Research Methods

This subject taught the fundamentals of research writing and conduct,
using a mock research topic.
[Handbook link](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2020/subjects/comp90044/).
Final grade forthcoming.

Assessment:

* Following some of my work from the previous semester,
  I chose the topic of *distributional reinforcement learning*.

* For the first assignment, I compiled a
  [literature review](2020s2-comp90044/farrugia2020distRL-review.pdf)
  on distributional reinforcement learning.

    I wrote this review for a general CS audience, which was initially
    challenging given the mathematical tone of much of the literature.
    In the end, I was impressed by how I was able to distill the important
    messages without resorting to any equations. In fact, on several
    occasions I was only attempting to introduce mathematical detail for
    its own sake, and I obtained a more cohesive review after removing it.
    (For a more technical report, see my work for Neural Systems from 2020s1.)

* For the second assignment, I designed and reported a
  [research plan](2020s2-comp90044/farrugia2020distRL-plan.pdf)
  for investigating a research question identified during my review.

    Once again, this plan was written for a general audience and I was
    impressed with my success at avoiding technical language and still
    communicating my ideas.

    Note: I did not actually execute this research plan, and indeed the
    plan is written for a very ideally-resourced researcher. However, I
    am considering following up on my question in the future.

* For the final assignment, I prepared a 5 minute talk describing my plan,
  for which I submitted this
  [transcript and slide deck](2020s2-comp90044/farrugia2020distRL-talk.pdf).

    Note: I was not asked to present this talk, but I did prepare as if to
    present it as part of validating the timing and balance of the talk.

### Semester 1, 2020 ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ðŸ¦ 

This semester, I went on an exchange to ETH ZÃ¼rich. I had to return early
due to the pandemic, but after recovering from this disruption I was able
to complete my studies from Melbourne (living on ZÃ¼rich time to attend
live Zoom lectures) including a group project on links between neuroscience
and artificial intelligence:

#### Neural Systems

This subject, billed as 'an introduction to neuroscience for engineers',
pushed me far outside of my confort zone. I will publish details of my
project work shortly.
