# Coursework Portfolio

A directory of of my advanced coursework projects from the Master of Computer
Science at The University of Melbourne

## Notes

* While the reports written for my university projects usually end up quite
  polished by the submission deadline, the code usually does *not*.
  This code is usually written over a short project timescale, typically a
  only a few weeks. It's often not intended for readability. I encourage
  not looking too closely.

### 2021

In 2021, having completed my coursework, I will embark upon my
1-year Master's thesis project.
The plan is to study the mathematics of deep learning algorithms
with [Assistant Professor Dr. Daniel Murfet](http://therisingsea.org/)
over in the School of Mathematics and Statistics.
Wish me luck!

### Semester 2, 2020 ðŸ¦  

This semester was completed at the University of Melbourne's virtual campus.

#### COMP90044 Research Methods

This subject taught the fundamentals of research writing and conduct,
using a mock research topic.
[Handbook link](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2020/subjects/comp90044/).
Final grade forthcoming.


Assessment:

* Following some of my work from the previous semester,
  I chose the topic of *distributional reinforcement learning*.

* For the first assignment, I compiled a
  [literature review](2020s2-comp90044/farrugia2020distRL-review.pdf)
  on distributional reinforcement learning.

    I wrote this review for a general CS audience, which was initially
    challenging given the mathematical tone of much of the literature.
    In the end, I was impressed by how I was able to distill the important
    messages without resorting to any equations. In fact, on several
    occasions I was only attempting to introduce mathematical detail for
    its own sake, and I obtained a more cohesive review after removing it.
    (For a more technical report, see my work for Neural Systems from 2020s1.)

* For the second assignment, I designed and reported a
  [research plan](2020s2-comp90044/farrugia2020distRL-plan.pdf)
  for investigating a research question identified during my review.

    Once again, this plan was written for a general audience and I was
    impressed with my success at avoiding technical language and still
    communicating my ideas.

    Note: I did not actually execute this research plan, and indeed the
    plan is written for a very ideally-resourced researcher. However, I
    am considering following up on my question in the future.

* For the final assignment, I prepared a 5 minute talk describing my plan,
  for which I submitted this
  [transcript and slide deck](2020s2-comp90044/farrugia2020distRL-talk.pdf).

    Note: I was not asked to present this talk, but I did prepare as if to
    present it as part of validating the timing and balance of the talk.

### Semester 1, 2020 ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ðŸ¦ 

This semester, I went on an exchange to ETH ZÃ¼rich. I had to return early
due to the pandemic, but after recovering from this disruption I was able
to complete my studies from Melbourne (living on ZÃ¼rich time to attend
live Zoom lectures) including a group project on links between neuroscience
and artificial intelligence:

#### 227-0395-00L Neural Systems

This subject, billed as 'an introduction to neuroscience for engineers',
pushed me far outside of my confort zone. I will publish details of my
project work shortly.
[Details](http://www.vvz.ethz.ch/Vorlesungsverzeichnis/lerneinheit.view?lang=en&semkez=2020S&lerneinheitId=135004&).
ECTS credits: 6.
Final grade: 6.0 (6.0 scale).

TODO: Add assessment details

#### 252-0526-00L Statistical Learning Theory

This subject pushed my mathematical background and deepened my understanding
of statistics and machine learning.
[Details](http://www.vvz.ethz.ch/Vorlesungsverzeichnis/lerneinheit.view?lerneinheitId=136191&semkez=2020S&ansicht=KATALOGDATEN&lang=en).
ETCS credits: 7.
Final grade: 5.75 (6.0 scale).

* The class involved fortnightly programming projects using Jupyter notebooks,
  numpy, scipy, matplotlib, etc.

    I will not publish my work for these projects because, as I understand,
    the same projects will be used in future semesters.

* However, some code I whipped up while studying similar topics during the
  semester is available in other repositories:
  * [Constant-shift embedding method for graph layout](https://github.com/matomatical/cse-graph-layout)
  * [Estimation of Gaussian mixture model parameters using EM algorithm](https://github.com/matomatical/gmm-em-algorithm)
    ![Gaussian mixture models estimation animation](https://github.com/matomatical/gmm-em-algorithm/blob/master/em.gif)

#### 252-1424-00L Models of Computation

A whistle-stop tour of many exciting and exotic models of computation, beyond
the traditional FSAs, CFGs and TMs.
[Details](http://www.vvz.ethz.ch/Vorlesungsverzeichnis/lerneinheit.view?lerneinheitId=136149&semkez=2020S&ansicht=KATALOGDATEN&lang=en).
ETCS credits: 6.
Final grade: 6.0 (6.0 scale).

* This subject offered challenging weekly puzzles, several for each new model
  of computation which we studied.

    I was proud to complete every puzzle successfully. However, so as not to
    spoil these puzzles for future students I will not publish my solutions.

* The final project involved designing and studying and then lecturing about
  my own model of computation.

#### 363-0588-00L Complex Networks
  
[Details](http://www.vvz.ethz.ch/Vorlesungsverzeichnis/lerneinheit.view?lerneinheitId=135015&semkez=2020S&ansicht=KATALOGDATEN&lang=en).
ECTS credits: 4.
Final grade: 6.0 (6.0 scale)


## TODO:

Notes to self:

* Add project details for neural systems group project.
* Add final project details for models of computation.
* Add projects details and reports from 2019 machine learning classes and
  compiler project from PLI.
* Add Sierpinski triangle image for Models of Computation.
